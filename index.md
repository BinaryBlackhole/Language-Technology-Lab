The Language Technology lab was created in 2010, when [Dr. Gaurav Harit](http://home.iitj.ac.in/~gharit/gharit/index.html) 
joined the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur](https://cse.iitj.ac.in/) from [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/).  
Our research interests span many areas of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning but core focus on the development of the datasets, algorithms and statistical inference 
methods for analyzing, extracting and searching information in documents, videos, Image, Video and Text data.
Our work has appeared consistantly in several top conferences such as CVPR, ICDAR, ICIP, DAS, ACCV and so on.

## Research  Areas
* Handwritten Document Analysis
* Scene Text Recognition
* Visual Question-Answering
* Human Activity Recognition
* Video Analysis
* Language Understanding

### Highlights
1) Our paper "TransDocAnalyser: A framework for semi-structured offline handwritten documents analysis with an application to legal domain- Sagar Chakraborty, Gaurav Harit and Saptarshi Ghosh" accepted as "Oral Presentation" in 
[17th Internation Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR)] (https://icdar2023.org/).
